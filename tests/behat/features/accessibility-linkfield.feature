  As a content editor
  I want to create and interact with LinkField using the keyboard

  Background:
    Given I add an extension "SilverStripe\FrameworkTest\LinkField\Extensions\LinkPageExtension" to the "Page" class
    And I go to "/dev/build?flush"
    And there are the following Page records
    """

      Page: =>Page.page-1
